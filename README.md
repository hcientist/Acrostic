# Acrostic

This is a good bit of the work for making a little [acrostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic) UI in React (as a way of getting started with React via the Create React App, see below). It's part of JMU CS 347 Fall 2021's curriculum (see [Lab 18 on Dr. Johnson's site](https://twodee.org/blog/18258)).
